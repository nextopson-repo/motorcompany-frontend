      At <strong>Dhikcar</strong>, we always aim to deliver a smooth and
      transparent experience for every user. However, we understand that
      situations may arise where a refund is necessary. This Refund Policy
      outlines how refund requests are handled for any paid services made on our
      platform.
    </p>
    <p className="text-sm">
      <strong>Dhikcar is a car marketplace platform</strong> where{" "}
      <strong>dealers and owners post their cars</strong> for sale, and{" "}
      <strong>buyers contact them directly</strong> through our platform. We do
      not sell or buy vehicles ourselves. Our role is to provide a digital space
      where listings can be displayed, promoted, and connected with potential
      buyers. All payments made on Dhikcar are strictly for{" "}
      <strong>promotional and visibility-based services</strong>, such as
      premium listings, featured ads, or other paid display options—not for
      vehicle transactions.
    </p>
    <p className="text-sm">
      If you have made a payment for any of our premium or promotional services
      and face an issue, Dhikcar offers a{" "}
      <strong>24-hour refund guarantee</strong>. You are eligible for a full
      refund if the service you purchased has not been activated, or if there
      was a technical issue on Dhikcar’s side that prevented proper delivery of
      your service. Refunds may also be considered if a payment was made by
      mistake and the service has not yet been used.
    </p>
    <p className="text-sm">
      To request a refund, you must contact us within <strong>24 hours</strong>{" "}
      of making the payment. Please email{" "}
      <a href="mailto:thedhikcar@gmail.com" className="text-blue-600 underline">
        thedhikcar@gmail.com
      </a>{" "}
      with your registered details, transaction ID, and a short description of
      the issue. Once your request is verified, our team will initiate the
      refund process within <strong>2 to 3 business days</strong>, and the
      amount will be credited to your original payment method.
    </p>
    <p className="text-sm">
      Refunds will <strong>not</strong> be provided in cases where the service
      has already been activated or used, or if the request is made after 24
      hours of payment. Refunds are also not applicable for dissatisfaction due
      to low responses or limited buyer inquiries, as Dhikcar does not control
      user engagement. Additionally, Dhikcar will not be responsible for
      incorrect or incomplete listings, user-provided errors, or third-party
      payment delays.
    </p>
    <p className="text-sm">
      Our goal is to ensure that all refund requests are handled fairly and
      efficiently. Dhikcar reserves the right to reject refund requests found to
      be fraudulent, repetitive, or abusive. In such cases, appropriate action
      may be taken, including account suspension to protect the integrity of our
      platform.
    </p>
    <p className="text-sm">
      We may update this policy from time to time to align with new services,
      payment methods, or legal requirements. Any updates will be published on
      our website with a revised effective date.
    </p>
    <p className="text-sm">
      At Dhikcar, your trust means everything to us. We’re a growing
      marketplace, and we’re committed to providing honest service and a
      positive experience for everyone using our platform. If you ever face an
      issue or have concerns about your payment, please reach out—our team is
      always ready to help and make things right.
