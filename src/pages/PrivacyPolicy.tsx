      is an online <strong>car marketplace platform</strong> that connects
      <strong>vehicle owners and dealers</strong> who wish to sell their cars
      with <strong>potential buyers</strong> who are looking to purchase them.
      Our role is limited to facilitating communication and interaction between
      users. We do not own, buy, or sell cars directly, nor do we participate in
      the negotiations or transactions between buyers and sellers. Because we
      act as a bridge between parties, we collect certain personal information
      to enable smooth and trustworthy communication within our platform.
    </p>
    <h2 className="text-lg mt-10 font-semibold">2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p className="text-sm">
      When you use Dhikcar, we collect certain types of information to operate
      efficiently, enhance your experience, and ensure safety and transparency
      on the platform. <br /> We collect information in the following ways:
    </p>
    <h3 className="font-semibold">(a) Information You Provide to Us:</h3>
    <p className="text-sm">
      When you register or create an account, you provide details such as your
      <strong>name, email address, phone number, password, and location</strong>
      . When you post a listing, we collect <strong>car-related details</strong>{" "}
      like brand, model, year, mileage, photos, registration number (if shared),
      asking price, and description. If you contact other users through Dhikcar,
      we collect{" "}
      <strong>the content of your messages, inquiries, and calls</strong> made
      via our platform. In case you use any{" "}
      <strong>paid promotional services</strong>, we may also collect
      payment-related details, but we never store your complete payment card
      data — these are securely handled by our third-party payment partners.
    </p>
    <h3 className="font-semibold">(b) Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
    <p className="text-sm">
      When you use our platform, we automatically collect technical data about
      your device and usage behavior, including your{" "}

        IP address, browser type, device identifiers, pages visited, time spent,
        and general location (city or region)
      </strong>
      . This helps us understand how users interact with our platform, improve
      performance, and ensure security.
    </p>
    <h3 className="font-semibold">(c) Information from Third Parties:</h3>
    <p className="text-sm">
      We may receive information from external partners such as{" "}
      <strong>
        advertising platforms, analytics services, or login providers (e.g.,
        Google sign-in)
      </strong>
      . This data helps us verify your identity, improve our service reach, and
